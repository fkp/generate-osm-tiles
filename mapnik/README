The osm_xxxx.xml files in this directory want to be used in the shared area which the tile server normally uses so suggested that a symbolic link is created in here:
/etc/mapnik-osm-carto-data/

prior to running the script to render the data, which will typically refer to the script in this location (so relative paths to symbols for rendering work as expected).
